# SpeedHive
SpeedHive is a web-based internet speed test tracker that lets users measure their download, upload speed, and ping, store the results in MongoDB, and view their test history with charts. Built using Node.js (Express) for the backend and React for the frontend, it follows the MVC architecture for better scalability.
